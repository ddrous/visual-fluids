"""
Contains built-in physics functions, e.g. for fluids.
The actual physics functions are located in the sub-modules of `phi.physics`.
A common trait of many physics functions is the time increment (`dt`) argument.

Main class: `Domain`

See the `phi.physics` module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Physics.html
