PhiFlow is an open-source simulation toolkit built for optimization and machine learning applications.
It is written mostly in Python and can be used with NumPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch.
The close integration with machine learning frameworks allows it to leverage their automatic differentiation functionality,
making it easy to build end-to-end differentiable functions involving both learning models and physics simulations.

## Installation
See the [installation Instructions](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Installation_Instructions.html).
To install the latest stable version of PhiFlow:
```bash
$ pip install phiflow dash
